# README

This is a React on Rails sample app that I created for practice and is based off of a guide found on youtube.

The app builds a Mini-Course Website with React, Ruby on Rails, Webpacker, and Bootstrap. The end result is a styled webapp which fetches data in the same directoy using React on the front-end and Rails on the back-end.
